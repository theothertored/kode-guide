This is an expanded and improved version of the old Kode guide I wrote in Google Docs.  
It comes with major rewrites, more sections and examples, a light & dark mode, and an interactive table of contents.

It also works offline and can be installed like an app on your device.

Shoutouts to Bunn-E, Grabster and especially robin for motivating me to work on this overhaul.
