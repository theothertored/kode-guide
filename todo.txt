- open/close left drawer with a swipe (I already tried opening it like that without thinking and it went back to my new tab screen)
- "pick up where you left off" prompt
- favicon
- some kind of readme

DONE:
- expand the regex section a bit to maybe convince people to learn it
- hamburger to arrow animation for fab
- add some text explaining section links and copying examples
- double tap to copy example
- refactor the absolute bowl of spaghetti I have created (wasn't that bad lol)
- smaller/larger list entries for mouse/touchscreen
- mode switcher in left drawer so the mode can be changed from any position on the page
- fix light mode heavy border being the same color as the light border
