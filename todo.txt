- mode switcher in left drawer so the mode can be changed from any position on the page
- favicon
- "pick up where you left off" prompt
- double tap to copy example
- open/close left drawer with a swipe (I already tried opening it like that without thinking and it went back to my new tab screen)
- add some text explaining section links and copying examples

DONE:
- fix light mode heavy border being the same color as the light border
